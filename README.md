# WebBox
WebBox is a lightweight, out-of-the-box web framework for C# that provides a minimalist set of tools to build web applications without relying on external dependencies. With WebBox , developers can leverage the power of the standard .NET to handle HTTP requests and build web pages using plain C# code, without the need for additional packages or libraries. I made this library in no time.
